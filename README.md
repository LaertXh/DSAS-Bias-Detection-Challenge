# DSAS Bias Analysis Challenge

## Overview 
Welcome to the DSAS Hiring Practices Bias Analysis Challenge. This challenge revolves around a fictional company's hiring process.
The dataset is fully synthetic and build specifically for this challenge. The goal is to analyze the dataset and uncover potential biases while using supportive evidence.

## Scenario 
The company Kendrellis Enterprises is suspecting that it's hiering practices may be vonurable to potential biases. They have hiered a outiser consultant (thas's you) to investigate. Analyze their application history dataset to uncover any biases such as age, gender, race or any other form of unequal treatment. 

The company has the following hiring structure. Users apply which creates our applications table. Each appliccations goes through a AI acreening phase, most get rejected. Finally the ones that passed go enter the recruitment interview screening and again most get rejected. The ones that pass will then go to the techniacal interview and finally the selected applicants will go through the management interview which makes a final decision. 

## Objectives
1. Identify biases in any stage of the hiring process:
    - AI Screening
    - Recruiter Screening
    - Technical Interview Screeining
2. Create a thural report of your findings. The technology you use is up to you, some suggestions are:
    - PowerBI or Tableau dashboard
    - Jupyter Notebook (with readable markdown cells and visualizations)
    - A PDF or PowerPoint (with charts and summarized metrics)
    - Any other reasonable format that conveys the analysis and findings effectively
3. The final open ended question. There is 0 intended bias in the managment final decisions, however do you think that its fully free of bias considering what you found on the previous steps of the hiring process?

The goal of this challange is for you to showcase some of your skills that you have acquired in understanding and working with data. 
You can choose to work with the normalized tables and join thema s you please. Ther is a fully joined dataset that you can use if you choose to work with the full dataset. There are seperate documentation files for explaining the datasets inside the folders. Have fun.
